<p><strong>Design Elements</strong></p>
		  
		  <p> The colour scheme is a central part of our brand identity. We used a vibrant colour palette that reflects both the expressive world of theatre and the diversity of the LGBTQ+ community. The colours were chosen based on emotional resonance, symbolic meanings and accessibility considerations.</p>
		  
		  <p>#740318 Dark red refers to emotions such as deep passion and love. This dark red evokes the drama and intensity of theatre while also connecting to the red stripe of the rainbow flag. 
		  <p>#B93D22 Orange symbolizes courage, warmth and creativity. This colour is inviting and energizing, and it bridges red and yellow tones which gives a sense of dynamism like theatre itself.</p>
		  <p>#FDB92E Yellow signifies joy, visibility and optimism. This colour captures light and spotlight energy which is perfect for a website about theatre. As yellow is a symbol for positivity and visibility it relates to value in the LGBTQ+ community such as pride and the importance of visibility.</p>
		  #B3296D Pink symbolizes self-expression. Theatre is all about expressing yourself thus using a bold and expressive colour is a good option to celebrate individuality.</p>
		  <p>#5F2A88 Deep purple symbolizes depth and mystery as theatre thrives on mystery and transformation this colour fits well with the website. Furthermore, the colour purple is a colour that frequently comes back in various pride flags.</p>
		  <p>#D0B3FA Lavender has a great significance within the LGBTQ+ community as it became a symbol of LGBTQ+ resistant and a colour that symbolizes empowerment.</p>
		  <p>#117F84 Teal-Blue provides a cool balance to the warm tones and complements purple and pink well. It gives the palette depth and contrast and can reflect themes of truth, introspection and connection qualities that a theatre often seeks to explore.</p>
		  <p>#000 The purpose of using black is to ensure high contrast and maximum readability for text again bright backgrounds. The significance of using black is that it is clean, sharp and neutral it does not distract from the colour palette instead it allows each colour to stand out while keeping content accessible to everyone.</p>
		  <p>#FFF To maintain accessibility white is used to contrast with the vibrant colours and the use of black. White ensures readability and helps to make the content of the website pop visually when it is paired with a rich and vibrant colour palette. Additionally, white gives the website a minimal and modern feel and can balance out the expressiveness of the website. </p>
		  
		  <p><strong>Font Choices</strong></p>
		  <p> For our website, we chose the Google font Outfit, a geometric sans-serif typeface built from clean, simple shapes with no serifs at the ends of the strokes. This gives it a modern and minimal look that perfectly suits our website. Outfit complements the expressive, dynamic world of theatre by offering a wide range of font weights allowing us to create visually engaging pages that can shift from bold show titles to clear, readable body text. This mirrors the dramatic range of performance while keeping the website polished and professional. Our target audience, young to middle-aged LGBTQ+ individuals and allies see theatre as a powerful form of storytelling and identity. Outfit is an ideal choice for this group because of its geometric and inclusive design that symbolizes openness, clarity and diversity which are values that are deeply rooted in the LGBTQ+ community. Moreover, it pairs with vibrant colour palettes, and it is a neutral and non-performative font which offers a sense of balance. It gives flexibility as colour, and identity can be expressed through imagery, colours and the layout of the website thus using a neutral font gives the website a clean and unified feel.  Additionally since our audience is highly active on social media and often discovers new theatre experiences through digital platforms it is important to have a mobile-friendly font that is readable and eye-catching. Thus, Outfit’s screen-optimized and mobile-friendly design ensures that the website remains accessible, legible and engaging across all devices. </p>
		  
		  <p><strong>User Interface Elements</strong></p>
		  <p><strong>Filter button</strong></p><p> The filter button enables the users to sort blog posts by the latest, most popular and trending. This feature encourages exploration without overwhelming users, which makes it ideal for an audience that is curious about LGBTQ+ theatre. The filter button mimics familiar social media search behaviours where users use tags or filters to uncover relevant content. Furthermore, there’s a filter button on the tickets page. Through this visitors can filter per genres such as tragedy, comedy, drama and musical theatre. This can empower users to actively seek productions without overwhelming them by a lot of information.</p>
		
		  <p><strong>Menu organization</strong></p><p>The main menu sits at the top of every page with clear one-word labels such as home, about, blog, corporate and tickets. It does not have any dropdowns which makes it efficient and accessible. Our target audiences who is seeking affirming content does not want to dig through vague menu labels thus directness makes it simple for them to find what they are looking for.</p>
		
		  <p><strong>Carousels</strong></p>
		    <p> The homepage features a carousel of upcoming and current theatre productions. Each carousel slide includes a show title and image. Including a carousel is engaging and help to build a narrative atmosphere through visuals. It also mimics swipe-able interfaces of Instagram stories and TikTok which is familiar for 20- to 35-year-old users. Furthermore, it highlights multiple shows at once without overloading users with information which is ideal for users who are seeking out new LGBTQ+ productions.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong>Grids</strong></p>
		    <p> Blog posts are displayed using modular grid layouts, mostly 2 or 3 column responsive design. Each item includes a visual and title structured as a card. It is easy to read through and scan especially for theatre lovers who are searching for shows. Furthermore, it looks like a feed and mirrors social media platforms which is familiar with our target audience.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong>Footer</strong></p>
		    <p> The footer contains links to social media platforms, links to the different pages of the website, the logo, copyright and contact information of Out n Center. Thus, the footer provides important information that improves the user experience of the website. The footer functions as the conclusion of the website and offers additional navigation options.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong>Cards</strong></p>
		    <p> In the about page a meet the team section was created. All team members are represented in individual profiles that were arranged in rows and columns. Each profile includes a picture of the team member, name and study title. For these cards, a grid layout was used to present the various pieces of content in a visually appealing and structured format, and it ensures that everything is aligned.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong>Registration Form</strong></p>
		    <p> A Registering page was also created. This is structured with fields to fill in your name, email, username, password and users can upload a profile picture. It also contains a create profile button as well as a login button for users that already have an account. With an account users can see what tickets they have favourited, and they can add a subscription to their account.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong>Login Form</strong></p>
		  <p> A login interface is provided for users to access personalized features such as saving tickets to the cart and buying tickets or purchasing a subscription. This makes the experience more personalized.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Calendar</strong></p>
		  <p> The calendar interface displays upcoming shows in a visual, date-based layout. Users can scroll or click through the calendar to discover the dates that shows are being played. This format mimics the familiar grid-like interfaces of event apps and social platforms, making it intuitive for 20- to 35-year-olds. Furthermore, It supports planning and intentional attendance, especially for users who attend theatre 2–3 times per year and want to make the most of each visit.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Cart</strong></p>
		  <p> The cart page allows users to review and confirm their ticket selections before checkout. It is designed with a clear overview of the selected shows and the pricing. This page supports transparency and ease of use which are important for users who are digitally savvy and value clarity in online transactions.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Search Bar</strong></p>
		  <p> A search bar is placed which enabled users to quickly find specific shows or content. This feature caters to the digitally savvy audience who are accustomed to instant access to information, and it enhances their ability to explore theatre productions that resonate with their interests.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Social Media integration</strong></p>
		  <p> Icons linking to the brand’s social media platforms are integrated into the website which facilitates easy access to the platforms. This integration acknowledges the audience’s active participation in online theatre culture and their use of social media to discover new plays.</p>
		
		<p><strong>User Interface Patterns</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Media queries</strong></p>
		<p> In the whole website media queries were used to adjust the layout and styling of the website to different devices. This makes sure that the website is accessible for everyone, and it ensures that elements are responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes.</p>

<p><strong>Spinner</strong></p>
		<p> We used a spinner for when users are buying a ticket and click on purchase. By using a spinner, it showcases that their purchase is loading.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Structure of the navigation and content</strong></p>
		<p> The website is divided into distinct sections. Firstly, we have the homepage which highlights current and upcoming shows with brief descriptions and supporting visuals. We also have a blog which is divided within blog posts. These blog posts are articles, interviews and discussions related to LGBTQ+ theatre. Furthermore, there is a ticket page that is dedicated to ticket purchasing information on which you can also find your favourited plays so users can save tickets to purchase them later. Additionally, the website contains an about page which provided background information about OutnCenter. We decided to segment content to allow visitors to quickly find information relevant to their interests whether they are looking to attend a show, read articles or learn about the organization. Furthermore, structuring the content ensures that each section can be tailored to a specific purpose without overwhelming users with unrelated information. By structuring the pages into separate parts, audiences can be separated as visitors that are looking to attend events are kept separate from those interested in blog posts. Additionally, a navigation bar was added with clearly labelled links such as home, about, blog, corporate and tickets. This ensures that visitors can instantly see what areas are available and where to go which reduced cognitive load and it reduces confusion. Moreover, the main activities of the site are made directly accessible on the home page to make sure that users can access it quickly.</p>

        <h3 class="subheadings-content-part-corporate-page">Justification of Design Choices</h3>
		
      	<p><strong>How does website design fit the values and personality of the brand? </strong></p>
		<p> The website reflects the personality of Out n Center by being expressive, welcoming, and inclusive just like the Queer theatre community that it is built for. We have used a vibrant colour palette (like deep red, lavender, teal-blue, and yellow) to bring out the emotion and diversity that is central to both theatre and LGBTQ+ experiences. Each colour choice was intentional and helps support our brand values like authenticity, compassion, and visibility. The layout is clean and easy to navigate, ensuring that every website visitor can find what they are looking for. Additionally, it is designed to feel like a safe and supportive space, with content and features that highlight real stories, real people, and real theatre. All of this comes together to help the website feel true to the brand’s mission: creating a space where people can connect, learn, and celebrate Queer theatre together. </p>
		
		<p><strong>How does website design fit the marketing and communication strategy? </strong></p>
		<p> The design supports our marketing and communication goals by making it easy for people to discover content, explore shows, and engage with the brand in a way that feels natural. We have kept things simple, direct, and structured by creating different sections that can be found through the navigation bar. Thus, whether someone is browsing the blog, checking out shows, or learning about the platform, they can move around the website without getting lost. Features like the homepage carousel, blog grids, the filter and search tools help surface a variety of content while keeping things manageable. Moreover, we ensured that everything is mobile-friendly and easy to share, since our audience is active online and often discovers theatre through social media, </p>
		
		<p><strong>How does the website design help showcase the unique value proposition of the product? </strong></p>
		<p> Out n Center is all about Queer theatre. The website gets that across by putting LGBTQ+ shows and voices front and centre. The design helps users quickly see what is special about the platform: it is a place for news, reviews, upcoming performances, and real community connection. Furthermore, we have built features like saved shows, a filterable blog, a calendar, and personal profiles that let users engage on their own terms. The blog dives deeper than just promotional content, offering interviews and stories that give real insight into the Queer theatre scene. All of this is presented in a way that is familiar as it is similar to a layout of other theatre companies and easy to navigate, which makes the platform feel approachable for both long-time fans and people who are exploring. </p>
		
		<p><strong>User interface patterns and the structure of the navigation and content</strong></p>
		<p> We kept the navigation straightforward by using clear labels like "Home," "About," "Blog," and "Tickets" which helps users know exactly where they are going by clicking the buttons. Moreover, no dropdowns or vague titles were used as we used a clean menu that gets people where they want to be. The homepage uses a carousel to showcase shows in a visually engaging way, kind of like how people are used to swiping through content on social media. Blog posts and content sections use a grid layout that is easy to scan and feels familiar, especially to users who spend time on apps like Instagram or Pinterest. There is also a clear calendar view for upcoming performances and an easy-to-use filter button so users can find blog posts or shows by interest. The footer rounds things out with links to social platforms, contact information, and some quick navigation options. By using media queries the website is responsive and adapts to various devices. Furthermore, the website is not over-designed or cluttered, it is simple, clear, and functional, which is what we think our audience appreciates.</p>

    	 <!--start of Testing Protocol-->

		 <h3 class="subheadings-content-part-corporate-page" id="prodsub2">Testing Protocol</h3>
		
      	<p><strong>Testing Goals</strong></p>
		<p> By conducting a test with LGBTQ+ members or allies who are theatre lovers, the goal is to understand whether the website is functioning correctly, easy to navigate and clearly communicates its purpose to the target audience. This includes identifying any technical issues, confusing layouts or unclear content that might affect the user experience.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Testing Methods</strong></p>
		<p> During the test, participants will be shown the website of Out n Center. They will get the assignment to view every page and navigate themselves through the website. The ultimate goal for them is to buy tickets and read an article on the blog page. </p>
		
		<p><strong>Testing Participants</strong></p>
		<p> Four participants will be asked to visit the website on a computer and navigate through the website. These participants are 20 to 35 years old, part of the LGBTQ+ community or allies and they are theatre lovers who are looking for an easy and organized way of buying tickets for LGBTQ+ plays and reading authentic articles.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Test Setting</strong></p>
		<p> The test will be conducted on the BUas campus as many LGBTQ+ theatre lovers within the target age range of 20 to 35 years old can be found here. Furthermore, a computer will be used for the test because it closely reflects how most users in this demographic engage with theatre-related content and services. Specifically purchasing tickets and reading in-depth blogs posts are activities typically performed on larger devices like laptop or desktop computers, which offer better readability, easier navigation and a more stable user experience compared to mobile devices. Using a computer for the test ensures that feedback and interaction patterns accurately represent real world usage scenarios.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Test Protocol</strong></p>
		<p>The test conductors will make sure that one of their computers is functioning properly and has the website opened. This computer should be fully charged, and the test conductors will also prepare the sound recording software on their phone. One of the conductors will also film the testing so the camera person should make sure to have enough space on their phone to shoot the test.</p>
		
		<p><strong>The Test</strong></p>
		<p> The participant will be exposed to the website and the test conductor will explain the purpose of the test which is that the participants should navigate through the website and buy tickets and visit the blog page. The participants will be told to think out loud and tell the conductor what they are looking at, what they are expecting to happen and how they feel about what they are seeing. After explaining the purpose of the test and the instructions the test will start. </p>
		
		<p><strong>Post-test interview</strong></p>
		<p>After testing the participant will be asked if they have feedback on the website and if the website purpose was clear to them. Furthermore, it will be asked if they had any difficulties or found things confusing. Additionally, questions about the layout and design will be asked and the participants will be asked about suggestions for improvements</p>
		
		<p><strong>Testing goals per participant</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Participant one's goal: Plan a night out with friends at a theatre. </li>
			<li>Participant two's goal: Find a performance to see and buy tickets for it.</li>
			<li>Participant three's goal: Plan a night out and find a show to attend.</li>
			<li>Participant four's goal: Create a profile and subscribe to the subscription and buy tickets.</li>

		    <h3 class="subheadings-content-part-corporate-page">Marketing campaign</h3>
		
<p> <strong>Context of the campaign</strong></p>
<p>The campaign is centred on the message that authentic LGBTQ+ representation in theatre matters. It challenges harmful stereotypes and highlights the real-world impact of misrepresentation, by encouraging audiences to rethink how LGBTQ+ characters are portrayed.</p>
		
<p><strong>Campaign objective</strong></p>
		    <p>This campaign aims to foster a more accepting environment for LGBTQ+ characters in theatre by advocating for authentic representation. Misrepresentation, whether through stereotypes, one-dimensional portrayals, or tokenism, does not just fail the community, it actively harms it. Out n Center’s goal is to raise awareness about the impact of problematic representation and encourage creators to craft LGBTQ+ characters that feel real, complex, and human.</p>
		    
<p><strong>Key Messages</strong></p>
		    <p> To communicate the message that authentic representation matters, a series of strong, concise statements will be developed that highlight both the importance of representation and the harm of poor representation.</p>
		    <ul>
				<li>LGBTQ+ characters deserve depth, not stereotypes. </li>
				<li>Sexuality isn’t a personality! </li>
				<li>Representation shapes reality. When we reduce characters, we reduce people. </li>
				<li>Visibility should empower, not diminish. Authenticity matters.</li>

The inspirational and educational tone of the campaign raises awareness around misrepresentation and promotes nuanced portrayals of LGBTQ+ characters. The content provides the audience with an understanding to advocate for better representation.</p>
<p>The key message of the campaign “Authentic representation matters” and statements such as “Representation shapes reality” are emotionally resonant as well as good statements that catch the attention on social media platforms like Instagram. These type of messages support the reach objective by being shareable and engaging which can help to attract new followers.

The professional and visually bold posts on Instagram help to grow a strong follower base that aligns with the brand’s values. These platform specific strategies are designed to maximize visibility and to gain attention from the target audience</p>
<p>Lastly, the campaign links to the response objective by sharing an interactive Instagram story that encourages followers to share their opinion to the poll.</p>
		
<h3 class="subheadings-content-part-corporate-page">Channels and Platforms</h3>
		
<p>During the four-week marketing campaign various channels and platforms will be strategically utilized to reach and resonate with the target audience of theatre lovers 20 to 35 years old. These platforms were selected based on their high engagement rates among this demographic and their proven effectiveness in building communities around shared interests.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Instagram</strong></p>
      	<p>Instagram will serve as the main platform for professional and visually striking content that aligns with the campaign’s core message. Instagram is a visually driven platform which makes it ideal for sharing branded posts that emphasize themes like representation and inclusivity. It is also highly used among Gen Z and Millennials as 89% of Gen Z social media users are on Instagram (Schaefer, 2025) and 46,5% of Millennial social media users are on the platform (Opena, n.d.). Our target audience tends to engage with short form visual content thus, to showcase this Instagram is a good channel to reach the target audience</p>
		
		<p><strong>Instagram Approach:</strong></p>
      	<p>On Instagram professional posts will be shared showcasing the different sections of the website. Furthermore, videos will be posted where the importance of LGBTQ+ representation in theatre is discussed. Additionally, posts that highlight the harm of poor representation and the positive effects of good representation will continuously be posted. Posts will be shared on Instagram  twice or more times per week.</p>
		
		<p><strong>TikTok</strong></p>
      	<p>TikTok will serve as the second platform for Out n Center’s social media outings. This platform will be leveraged for its virality and entertainment-driven nature. As 60% of Gen Z (Hajiyeva, 2024) and 40% of Millennials (TikTok Insights: Research Tool | Learning and Resources, n.d.) are on the platform it is a good channel to reach out to our target audience. It is effective for reaching users through trending and comedic content which will be used to drive traffic to the campaign and the website.</p>
		
		<p><strong>TikTok Approach:</strong></p>
      	<p>Our TikTok campaign targets Gen Z and Millennials with short-form videos featuring LGBTQ+ show recommendations. By using humorous, trending content, we aim to connect with theatre lovers, boost brand visibility, and create a memorable presence. At least two posts will follow popular trends within the TikTok theatre community to foster engagement and direct viewers to our Instagram and website.</p>
		
<p>By combing TikTok and Instagram for the marketing campaign it is aimed to create a balanced and dynamic media mix as Instagram provides depth while TikTok builds buzz. Both outings on the platforms are aligned with the campaign’s objective to raise awareness and drive engagement.</p>

      		<h3 class="subheadings-content-part-corporate-page" id="marsub5">Learning Points</h3>
      		
			<p><strong>What did we learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Over our four-week campaign, we learned how to effectively reach theatre lovers in a fast-paced digital space. Trend-based video content outperformed static posts, showing the power of timely, relatable media on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Consistent posting helped to maintain visibility, and we found that posting at 14:00 led to higher engagement than earlier times, even as overall engagement fluctuated.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What worked well?</strong></p>
<p>We learned that our strongest content used humour, trends, and theatre references to connect with our audience and support both reach and affect objectives. TikTok and Instagram videos performed best, as it aligned with Gen Z and Millennial preferences and delivered our core message “authentic representation matters” in a relatable, engaging way. By posting consistently (twice a week or more) we sustained visibility and audience interaction. </p>
					
			<p><strong>What didn't work well?</strong></p>
<p>Visually strong static posts underperformed with our Gen Z and Millennial audience, showing a clear preference for dynamic video content. In future campaigns, we’ll use static visuals more interactively, like through Instagram stories or paired with reels. Additionally, popular hashtags did not significantly boost engagement or reach. Moving forward, we will test and refine hashtag strategies to better connect with our target audience. </p>
					
			<p><strong>What went as expected?</strong></p>
<p>Several assumptions were validated. We expected that trend-driven content would perform well especially when they are combined with humour and values-based messaging. In result, these posts saw higher interaction rates and raised awareness around authentic LGBTQ+ representation. Moreover, we successfully reached our goal of gaining 100+ followers who are theatre lovers on Instagram which proved that Instagram was the right platform to reach our target audience. Furthermore, we reached our goal of getting 1000 views on our first TikTok post, this shows that the campaign successfully resonated with the intended audience.</p>
					
			<p><strong>What did not go as expected?</strong></p>
<p>We overestimated the potential of Instagram posters as a primary engagement tool. While they effectively communicated our message they did not get as much interaction as expected. This highlighted a misalignment between the type of content and the audience behaviour as our followers preferred quick, emotional video content. Additionally, we expected to reach our goal of having 15% of our target audience responding to our poll on whether they would visit our website. Unfortunately only 15 users responded, and we needed 18 replies to reach our goal. We expected to reach this goal however more people viewed the story than actually interacted with it. </p>
			
			<p><strong>What would you do differently?</strong></p>
<p>If we were to run this campaign again we would, prioritize short-form video content especially on TikTok and Instagram Reels as this format clearly resonates more with our target audience. Moreover, we would incorporate more audience interaction features like Instagram polls, and we would consider investing in advertising our brand and using theatre influencers to promote our brand. Lastly, we would track results more closely from the start which could allow us to adjust the strategy at the start. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Reflect on the past work and describe what you learned</strong></p>
<p>Looking back, the campaign taught us how to communicate value driven messages in ways that are timely, engaging and relevant. Trend awareness and adaptability were proved to be essential to connect with our younger audience. Furthermore, we learned that interactive and video content are better suited in today’s social media environment. Through this campaign the importance of using the right  format for each platform was highlighted. To conclude, the campaign met its goals and gave us a clear idea on how to better inform our audience and engage with them in the future. </p>

      		<h3 class="subheadings-content-part-corporate-page" id="marsub6">Future Planning</h3>
      		
			<p><strong>What has been done?</strong></p>
			<p>Over the course of the four-week social media campaign, we focused on promoting the importance of LGBTQ+ representation in theatre across platforms like Instagram and TikTok. We produced a variety of content, including posters, recommendation posts and short-form videos. The majority of our Instagram content consisted of static posters and three Instagram Reels delivering key messages around representation while two TikTok posts leveraged trending audios within the TikTok theatre community to increase relatability and reach. Our campaign successfully built awareness as for instance, one of our TikToks received 2138 views and 109 likes and had higher engagement than our poster-based content on Instagram. This outcome highlighted that trend-based and short-form video content resonates more deeply with our target audience than static images. Moreover, in all our posts we placed call to actions that asked our viewers to visit the website to read more or find more theatre recommendations.</p>
					
			<p><strong>Changes in the future</strong></p>
			<p>However, we recognize several missed opportunities such as not using Instagram stories enough and not posting a lot of video content on TikTok and Instagram. Thus, if this project were to continue, we would create more trend-based content as those type of posts gained a lot of engagement. If we would have posted more trend-based content we could have seen stronger engagement as relatability and relevancy is important in social media environments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we would prioritize creating short form video content based on the success of TikTok videos and the Instagram reels. These videos could be both entertaining and informative like for instance, behind the scenes footage of Queer plays, interviews or memes about our brand. As seen during our campaign, video content about the brands values and play recommendations immediately grabbed the attention and encouraged interaction as it outperformed the poster content.</p>
			<p>During our campaign, we barely posted stories on Instagram, thus if the project would continue we would implement interactive content like polls, challenges, quizzes on Instagram stories. This allows followers to actively participate and could increase the brand visibility. Moreover, in the future paid advertisements and collaborations could be used to boost the reach. Paid advertisements could be used for important posts and collaborations with theatre influencers could be done to connect with more individuals from the LGBTQ+ theatre community.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the future we could post on different times and test what time for posting works best as now we consistently posted at 9:00 or 14:00 so in the future we could try to use different times to see if the engagement rates would increase and change.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Future Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Future recommendations for if the campaign would continue is to diversify content more often. Instead of focusing on static Instagram posters, we could create more dynamic content such as Instagram stories that include polls and we could also upload more short form videos and trend-based content. This would keep the content fresh, and more relatable to the audience.</p>
			<p>Moreover, it is recommended to post more consistently on TikTok as the posts did well on the platform and it is important to consistently respond to the ongoing trends in order to remain relevant and relatable. We unfortunately did not post as consistently and much on the platform thus in the future it is recommended to post as much on the platform as possible to share relatable and entertaining content and drive engagement. For instance, on our first post we got 2138 views and 109 likes thus we were able to reach a large group of theatre lovers therefore consistently posting on the platform could broaden the brand visibility and awareness.</p>
			<p>Additionally, it would be recommended to share TikToks on Instagram or promote the Instagram page on TikTok as both accounts did well. By promoting the different accounts, the interaction could be increased and keep the audience engaged on both platforms. </p>

Lack of authentic LGBTQ+ representation: some theatre shows often misrepresent or overlook LGBTQ+ stories. For instance, national queer theatre or other niche groups promote queer voices however their reach is limited. Frustrating theatre ticket systems: Booking tickets is often confusing.

      		<h3 class="subheadings-content-part-corporate-page">Justification</h3>
      		<p>Between lean canvas one, two and three many changes were made based on the deeper insights that were gained through interviews with the target audience. </p>
					
			<p><strong>Problem Focus</strong></p>
			<p>The problem focus changed from a general issue of theatre discoverability in lean canvas one to a more specific focus on LGBTQ+ representation and content accessibility in lean canvas two and three. As we found out that many individuals from our target audience where part of the LGBTQ+ community and were struggling with finding good LGBTQ+ representation in theatre, we decided to focus on them and narrow down the target audience. This problem focus was changed after the problem interviews revealed strong concerns about misrepresentation and the lack of centralized information and ticket buying for shows.</p>
					
			<p><strong>Solution Focus</strong></p>
			<p>In lean canvas one, the solution was very broad and general as it focused on aggregated listings, recommendations and community feature which mainly addressed usability issues of theatre ticket websites and show discovery issues. In lean canvas two the solution became narrower because an educational element was added like articles about LGBTQ+ misrepresentation in theatre. In lean canvas two the solution became more specific as a centralized ticket platform was introduced to solve frustrations about buying tickets and a blog for LGBTQ+ show reviews and educational content was added. These changes were made because the problem interviews highlighted that users wanted a space where they could find good LGBTQ+ shows and that they had issues with buying theatre tickets through current ticket systems and they found it difficult to find LGBTQ+ content and show reviews in one place. Earlier ideas like personalized recommendations were removed as our target audience prioritized an accessible, educational and entertaining platform. </p>
					
			<p><strong>Customer segment</strong></p>
			<p>The target audience shifted from general theatre-goers aged 20 to 35 in lean canvas one to 20- to 35-year-old theatre lovers who are part of the LGBTQ+ community or are allies who are seeking organized inclusive content. This was changed as interviews revealed that the LGBTQ+ community is often not represented well and there is not enough awareness about the misrepresentation in theatre as shows often contain stereotypical LGBTQ+ characters. Furthermore, the customer segment changed based on our solution interviews that revealed that a majority of interviewees are part of the LGBTQ+ community or allies that prefer progressive shows and thought-provoking articles.</p>
					
			<p><strong>Value Proposition</strong></p>
			<p>The value proposition evolved from a one-stop theatre platform in lean canvas one to a safe space promoting LGBTQ+ representation in theatre in lean canvas two and three. This was changed to create a space where anyone can get educated about LGBTQ+ representation and also discover new shows and buy tickets for LGBTQ+ shows after finding out in the problem interviews that the majority of our target audience is struggling with the misrepresentation of the LGBTQ+ community in theatre thus the focus shifted from a general one stop theatre platform for tickets and connection to a place for LGBTQ+ theatre show tickets and articles about representation and shows.</p>
					
			<p><strong>Revenue Model</strong></p>
			<p>In the first two lean canvases, the revenue streams were based on industry benchmarks and assumptions, including advertising, affiliate links, and a freemium model. Since we had not tested user willingness to pay or advertiser interest, there was no reason to adjust the revenue model before validating the problem and user needs. However, in Lean Canvas 3, the subscription model was updated based on user feedback. While users agreed to pay €2.99 per month, they expressed a preference for a free trial before committing to a subscription. In response, we added a free trial option to the subscription, aligning the monetization strategy with user expectations.</p>
					
			<p><strong>Channels</strong></p>
			<p>In lean canvas one the channels were broad as it was focusing on Google ads, flyers, word of mouth and advertising at theatre and campuses as well as on social media. In lean canvas two the list became more selective emphasizing social media and theatre advertising. In the problem interviews it was revealed that our target audience found out about shows through social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram thus we decided to mainly focus on social media. Then in lean canvas three TikTok and Instagram were kept as the core social media platforms based on audience behaviour. Furthermore, word of mouth and collaborations with theatre groups were added as channels because our interviews revealed that our target audience gets encouraged to go to a show through friends. Additionally, the problem interviews revealed that our target audience usually discover new shows through social media, so we changed the channels.</p>
					
			<p><strong>Cost Structure</strong></p>
			<p>Based on the interviews, the cost structure that we had across all the lean canvasses seemed fitting with the solution. Therefore, the same cost model is repeated, and no actual change has occurred. </p>
					
			<h3 class="subheadings-content-part-corporate-page">Validation of assumptions</h3>
      		<p>We chose our trademark Out n Center including the logo based on the service that is provided. The service that is provided is a digital platform where theatre lovers can buy tickets to LGBTQ+ plays and read blog articles about LGBTQ+ representation. Our brand is called Out n Center as a play on Front and Center of the stage and using out as coming out of the closet which refers to LGBTQ+ visibility and representation. This shows a familiarity to the target audience which creates a certain feel about the brand because we want the LGBTQ+ community to feel seen and represented on the theatre stage. Our logo includes our name and a “N” in the shape of two door with a spotlight shining in it. This should represent an open closet with a spotlight shining in it and representing the LGBTQ+ community. The use of a simple graphic that represents a deeper meaning makes the logo easy to remember which aims to create brand recognition and awareness. In this way, individuals will hopefully remember that anytime they want to find LGBTQ+ shows that Out n Center is the place to find it. An example of an already existing LGBTQ+ theatre brand is Out front theatre. Their trademark is different in contrast to Out n Center. Their name is more specifically indicating that it is about theatre and the logo is a rainbow circle with the brand name which showcases their LGBTQ+ community content and support. Their logo is more straightforward and strongly aligns with their values as a theatre company. Making our logo more straightforward is something we did not take as much into account. We chose to not implement a rainbow into our logo which is a recognized LGBTQ+ symbol. This was a deliberate decision which aimed to create a more open-ended visual identity. Instead of relying on established symbols, we wanted our logo to evoke inclusivity through tone and style while also allowing space for broader interpretation and future growth. Furthermore, another already existing LGBTQ+ theatre brand is StageQ. The brand name represents the last letter of LGBTQ+ and stage refers to the theatre stage which makes the brand name understandable and memorable. The logo of the brand is a Q with a rainbow line in the background of the Q, which shows that the theatre company represents and supports the LGBTQ+ community. </p>
